# Welcome To License Plate Recognition Project!

**Creators**: Rishi Raghavan (Project Lead), Ananya Goel , Aidan Wiktorowicz

**Project Summary**: This project creates and evaluates a model to recognise the state a license plate is from in the DMV+Delware area

## Repository Contents
This repository is the library for all code files, figures, and media related to our project. We encourage you to explore and learn more about our project!
You'll find the following: 

1) **SCRIPTS Folder**: All source code for the project can be found here. Located here is a master script file which compiles all script files into a single executable file that produces our project's results.  
2) **DATA Folder**: The main CSV file with information about license plates and folders for all license plate images from all 4 states.
3) **OUPUT Folder**: This folder contains all project outputs, including figures from our project presentation.   
4) **License.md**: Guidelines for citation of our repository.

## Software and Platform
Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC) was the primary software through which our project was coded. We used the Python coding language, and the Pytesseract and open CV packages in Python were  add-ons installed to perform prediction analysis. Microsoft VSC was run on both Windows and MacOS software, aiding in versatility and accessibility of our project. 

## Documentation Map
**DATA**:
- us-license-plates (.csv)
